# Fix Summary for localhost:7010 Issue

## Problem
When transcript extraction failed, only the "Try Again" button was showing. The alternative options ("Generate AI Thread Anyway" and "Enter Manual Transcript") were not visible.

## Root Cause
The `isGenerating` state was remaining `true` after transcript extraction failed, which prevented the navigation options from showing due to the condition:
```javascript
{showNavigationOptions && !showManualInput && !isGenerating && (
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Error Handling in `EnhancedVideoModal.tsx`
- Set `isGenerating` to `false` immediately when transcript extraction fails
- Added setTimeout to ensure state updates properly before showing navigation options
- Added debug logging to track state changes

### 2. Simplified Navigation Options Condition
- Removed `!isGenerating` requirement from navigation options visibility check
- Now shows navigation options based only on `showNavigationOptions && !showManualInput`

### 3. Added Debug Logging
- Console logs for tracking transcript extraction failures
- Console logs for navigation actions

## Test Results
✅ All navigation options now appear when transcript extraction fails
✅ "Generate AI Thread Anyway" button works
✅ "Enter Manual Transcript" button works  
✅ Navigation to editor page works with empty transcript

## How to Verify
1. Start server: `PORT=7010 npm run dev`
2. Search for any video
3. Click "Generate AI Thread"
4. When transcript extraction fails, you should see:
   - Try Again button
   - "Continue without transcript?" section with:
     - Generate AI Thread Anyway button
     - Enter Manual Transcript button

## Files Modified
- `components/EnhancedVideoModal.tsx` - Fixed state management and navigation options visibility
