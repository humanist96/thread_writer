# Transcript Extraction Error Fix Summary

## Issue
When transcript extraction failed for videos without captions, only the "Try Again" button was showing. The alternative options ("Generate AI Thread Anyway" and "Enter Manual Transcript") were not visible on the first failure.

## Root Cause
The `showNavigationOptions` state was being reset to `false` during retry attempts, and `isGenerating` was still `true` after the error, preventing the navigation options from displaying.

## Solution
1. Set `isGenerating` to `false` immediately after transcript extraction fails
2. Remove the line that hides navigation options during retry attempts
3. Ensure navigation options show on first failure, not just after max retries

## Changes Made

### EnhancedVideoModal.tsx
```typescript
// In handleExtractTranscript catch block:
setExtractionError(errorMessage)
setShowNavigationOptions(true)  // Show immediately
setIsGenerating(false)          // Stop generating state

// In handleRetry:
// Removed: setShowNavigationOptions(false)
```

## Test Results
✅ All navigation options now appear when transcript extraction fails:
- Try Again button
- Continue without transcript? text
- Generate AI Thread Anyway button  
- Enter Manual Transcript button

✅ Navigation to editor works with all alternative options
✅ Manual transcript input flow works correctly

## How to Test
1. Start server on port 7010: `PORT=7010 npm run dev`
2. Search for a video without captions
3. Click "Generate AI Thread"
4. When extraction fails, all options should be visible
5. Click "Generate AI Thread Anyway" to proceed to editor
